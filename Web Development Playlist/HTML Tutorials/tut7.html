    <!-- Ul tags represents unordered list the list items created in the ul tag wont have any numbering -->
    <!-- LI tag means list item these tags must be used inside ul or ol tag -->
    <!-- OL tag means ordered list that means this list will have numbering -->
    <!-- UL also has a attribute called type which allows to change the type of character to be shown in the list -->
    <!-- Available type attribute values for UL is "disc", "circle", "square" -->
    <!-- OL also has the type attribute as it is ordered list and order can be shown in multiple ways -->
    <!-- Available type attribute values for OL is "i", "I", "a", "A", "1" -->
    <ul type = "square">
        <li>This is my first item of my unordered list</li>
        <li>This is my second item of my unordered list</li>
        <li>This is my third item of my unordered list</li>
    </ul>

    <ol type = "1">
        <li>This is my first item of my ordered list</li>
        <li>This is my second item of my ordered list</li>
        <li>This is my third item of my  ordered list</li>
    </ol>

    <!-- NOTE : it is not recommended to use type attribute for OL and UL tag here because it is a style property and must be used with CSS -->
    
    <!-- We can also created nested lists -->
    <ul>
        <li>This is the first element</li>
        <ol>
            <li>This is the first nested element</li>
            <li>This is the second nested element</li>
        </ol>
    </ul>

    <!-- TABLES IN HTML -->
    <h3>HTML Table</h3>
    <!-- we have to use table tag to create a table inside html -->
    <!-- We must use two another tags inside the table tag those are <thead> and <tbody> where thead represents the head of the table and tbody represents the body of the table -->
    <!-- <tr> tag means table row tag we have to keep each row inside one tr tag -->
    <!-- inside tr tag we have two types of tag <th> : table heading tag and <td> table description tag. Here <th> tag will be used inside the thead tag while the td will be used inside the tbody tag to write a data to a cell -->
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Name</th>
                <th>Employee Id</th>

            </tr>
