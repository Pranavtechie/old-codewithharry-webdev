    <!-- a tag : anchor tag : has a attribute called href which takes us to the following address and the text between the anchor tag is displayed in the browser -->
    <a href="https://google.com">Go to Google</a><br>
    <!-- By default the link opens in the same tab to open the link in new tab we have to use another attribute called target and set it's value to "_blank" -->
    <a href="http://google.com" target="_blank">Go to google in new tab</a><br>

    <!-- we can also give internal links using the / before the file name -->
    <a href="/5. Heading & Paragraphs.html">Go to Heading and Paragraphs Page</a><br>

    <!-- img tag is used to present images in the document src attribute is used to get the location of the image. If the images fails to load we have to use the alt attribute to display the text (NOTE : the alt attribute text is only shown when the image loads to fail) -->
    <img src="harry.jpg" alt="Error Loading Image">
